<p>I'm a machine learning researcher at <a href="http://www.saenoon.co.kr/">Saenoon</a> where I am responsible to develop deep learning solutions for CCTV applications. Before that, I received my MS degree in Computer Science from Kyung Hee University, South Korea. My research interests include exploring challenging research problems in the field of machine learning.</p>
