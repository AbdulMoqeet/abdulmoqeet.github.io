I am a Senior Scientist at [Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence](http://www.inceptioniai.org/) since 2018. Previously, I was a Research Scientist in the Computer Vision Research Group (CVRG) at [Data61](http://www.data61.csiro.au/), [CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/) (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization) from 2016-18. I am also an Adjunct Lecturer at [College of Electrical & Computer Science](http://cecs.anu.edu.au/) (CECS), [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) (ANU) since 2016.<br><br>


I completed my PhD in Computer Vision from [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/) (UWA), under the supervision of [W/Prof. Mohammed Bennamoun](https://scholar.google.ae/citations?user=ylX5MEAAAAAJ&hl=en). My PhD thesis received `[Honorable Mention on the Dean's List](http://www.postgraduate.uwa.edu.au/students/funding/prizes/board-of-the-graduate-research-school-deans-list)' award at the UWA. I also completed an internship at [NICTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NICTA) (National ICT Australia) in 2015 and served as an research affiliate with [Australian Center for Robotic Vision](https://www.roboticvision.org/) (ACRV) during 2016-18.
