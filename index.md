<p>I am final year MS student, working on efficient deep learning models for image restoration, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EULut5oAAAAJ">Dr. Sung-Ho Bae</a> at Kyung Hee University, South Korea. Before that, I received the BS degree in Computer Science, from University of Karachi, Pakistan. I like to work on inverse problems or those problems contisting multi-modalities through unsupervised or semi-supervised machine learning techniques. </p>
